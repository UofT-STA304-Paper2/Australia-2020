# Examining Life Satisfactions of Australians in 2020

This repository includes all the folders and subfolders containing data and resources needed to reproduce our paper discussing about life satisfactions of Australian people. 

It is organised as follows:
The scripts folder includes an R script showing preparation needed to access our data;
The inputs folder includes a data subfolder showing data where our graphs and tables come from, and a literature subfolder containing all the articles we cited in our paper (if any);
The ouput folder contains a paper subfolder, which includes our references, and both pdf and rmd versions of our paper.
